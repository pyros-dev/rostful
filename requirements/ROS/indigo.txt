# pytest-xdist==1.8  # for --boxed
# hypothesis==3.0.1  # backported to indigo as https://github.com/asmodehn/hypothesis-rosrelease

# TESTS are outside the package : they dont need to match the system packages on the corresponding ROS DISTRO
# since they willnot be distributed as part of the package.

# Package Dependencies need to match ROS (or trusty's) package version
